# Train-Scheduler
This website is created to help user with the trains schedule. It requires from user to enter the train they want to have information about, its destination and its frequency and this program finds out when the next train is coming and how many minutes is it away.

Steps used to complete this task:

1. Create Firebase Project on console.firebase.google.com.
2. Initialise Firebase in the JS file.
3. Create two separate panels on Html file, one to get user input and one to display the information required.
4. Save user input in variables, sent it to database and display it in the screen.
5. Create a way to calculate the time and min away.


* I did not use a CSS styling sheet for this project. Insead I used bootstrap and made just some little modifications to it with inline CSS.
