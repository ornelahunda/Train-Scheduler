# Train-Scheduler
This is a train schedule application created to help user with the trains schedule. It requires from user to enter the train they want to have information about, its destination and its frequency and this program finds out when the next train is coming and how many minutes it is away.

# Technology used: 

+ This app is hosted on Firebase and the data is stored globally.
+ I have used HTML, CSS, and jQuery to render the schedule and admin panel on the web page.
+ Moment.js library to manipulate the data giving up to date information about the train schedules, time of arrival and minutes to arrival.


# Steps used to complete this task:

1. Create Firebase Project on console.firebase.google.com.
2. Initialise Firebase in the JS file.
3. Create two separate panels on Html file, one to get user input and one to display the information required.
4. Save user input in variables, sent it to database and display it in the screen.
5. Create a way to calculate the time and min away with Moment.js


* I did not use a CSS styling sheet for this project. Insead I used bootstrap 3.3.7 and made just some little modifications to it with inline CSS.
